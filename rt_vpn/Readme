* What's this script for:
    Set route table for vpn users. After this, traffic related to chinese ip will be guided to use your former gateway, such that throughput of vpn sever will be saved. :)

* Files:

* How to use?
    1. Put your former gateway at the *1st* line of gateway.txt, such as 192.168.0.1
       Or trigger the following command *BEFORE* vpn connection is made.
            route get 0.0.0.0 | grep "gateway" | grep -oE "([0-9]+\.){3}[0-9]+" > gateway.txt 
    2. Trigger the following command:
          sudo ./runme.sh
    3. Have fun. 

* Then why so many files?
    cn_net_addr.lst: chinese ip database
    extra_ip.lst: other ips you want to use your former gateway
    gateway.txt: former gateway
    runme.sh: main script, set gateway according to cn_net_addr.lst 
    update.py: update cn_net_addr.lst 
    last-modified: last-modified time to ip database
    
* I want to add route entries other than the list provided by APNIC.
    Put the hosts or nets in extra_ip.lst. Be careful of the format, the entries should look like this:
        64.233.189.0/24
    or 
        64.233.189.99
    DO NOT use abbreviate version like 64.233.189/24, MAC OS X tends to treat it as 64.233.0.189/24 and you will get screwed.

* How to clean route table 

    It is neccessary to clear your route table somtimes, for example, you forget to change the gateway before trigger runme.sh, or sth else stupid. "$ sudo route flush" is invented to do so but I found it did not work for me. So I just add another functionallity to runme.sh and you can use it by this: 
    
    Say we want to delete all route entires with gateway "192.168.0.1"
    
    1. put the gateway you want to delete at the *1st* line of gateway.txt
    2. trigger "sudo ./runme.sh -c"
