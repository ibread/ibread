Description:
------------

The src directory contains files used by the tpch_*.pl scripts and
should not be modified.

The tpch_*.tar.gz files contain the source code for the TPC-H data and query
generation tool.

The makefile* contain predefined makefiles for the TPC-H code. Note that
the TPC-H code does not come with a makefile, rather a template that
needs to be modified by the user.

The *.sql file contains SQL commands for creating the schema, constraints,
indexes etc.

The GetOptions.pm is a user-defined perl library used to parse the *.properties
files.
